                <h2>The Core Foundations: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h2>
                <p>Every web developer's journey begins with the three fundamental technologies of the web. They are the building blocks of virtually every website you visit.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</strong> This is the skeleton of your webpage. It provides the structure and content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.</li>
                    <li><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> This is the skin. CSS is used to style the HTML content, controlling everything from colors and fonts to layouts and animations.</li>
                    <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> This is the brain. JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to your websites, enabling features like interactive forms, dropdown menus, and real-time content updates.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Choosing a Path: Front-End, Back-End, or Full-Stack</h2>
                <p>Once you have a solid grasp of the basics, you can specialize:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Front-End Development:</strong> Focuses on the user-facing side of a website. Front-end developers use frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js to build rich, interactive user interfaces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Back-End Development:</strong> Deals with the server, database, and application logic. Back-end developers work with languages like PHP, Python, Node.js, or Java to power the website from behind the scenes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Full-Stack Development:</strong> A full-stack developer is a jack-of-all-trades who is comfortable working on both the front-end and back-end parts of an application.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>No matter which path you choose, continuous learning is key. The web development landscape is always evolving, so staying curious and up-to-date with new technologies will ensure a long and successful career.</p>
