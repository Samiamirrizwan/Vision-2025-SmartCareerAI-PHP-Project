                    <p class="reveal">
                        Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, computer science, and domain expertise. To excel, you must build a strong foundation in several key areas.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="reveal">
                        <li><strong>Statistics and Probability:</strong> Understanding statistical models and probability theory is crucial for making accurate predictions and inferences from data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Programming Skills:</strong> Proficiency in languages like Python or R is essential. Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow are the data scientist's primary tools.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Wrangling and Preprocessing:</strong> Real-world data is often messy. A significant amount of time is spent cleaning, transforming, and organizing data to prepare it for analysis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Knowledge of ML algorithms—from linear regression to neural networks—is necessary to build predictive models.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="reveal">Career Paths in Data</h2>
                    <p class="reveal">The field of data offers diverse roles beyond the "Data Scientist" title:</p>
                    <ul class="reveal">
                        <li><strong>Data Analyst:</strong> Focuses on interpreting data to identify trends and create reports and visualizations to inform business decisions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Engineer:</strong> Builds and maintains the data infrastructure and pipelines necessary for data scientists to work efficiently.</li>
                        <li><strong>Machine Learning Engineer:</strong> Specializes in deploying and scaling machine learning models in production environments.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="reveal">
                        Embarking on a data science career is a commitment to lifelong learning. The tools, techniques, and technologies are constantly advancing, making it one of the most dynamic and exciting fields in tech today.
